Who hasn't thought about traveling in time and giving brilliant advice to your younger self?
I occasionally wonder what message I would deliver, what thing I would want to change to
make my life better. It's tempting to go with investment tips so I'd be rich, or books to
read or courses to take so I'd be more successful, or people to meet so I'd be happier. The
truth is, if I had one message to send to past me, it wouldn't be any of those things.

I just finished watching series 2 of Derek. It's a show that tends to make you laugh and
cry during each episode, and often surprises you in much the same way that being run over
by a blue tortoise is surprising. You probably never saw it coming and
waitwhat-was-that-really-a-tortoise?

One of the characters, Kevin, is a very unpleasant person. He never really grew up, but
not in the charming Peter Pan kind of way. He's more like the fat middle-aged dirty uncle
who thinks of himself as Peter Pan. There was a poignant scene at the end of series 1 when
you realize that Kevin isn't deluding himself. He really understands who he is, and doesn't
have the wherewithal to change. It's easy to dislike him.

Yet in episode 5 I saw a side of him that made me love him. I still dislike him (as much
as one can dislike a fictional person...) But seeing his character develop has helped me
to understand him and to feel empathy for the guy, and now I love him a little bit too.

When I think of past me, I know that there were people I disliked without making an effort
to understand them. If I'm honest, present me still does this sometimes. I've come to
realize that the message to my former self would be to learn to empathize. With everyone.
Not just with the people that I like, but with the people that I don't - *especially* those
people. I wouldn't have to agree with them on everything, but connecting with them and
understanding them is better than making assumptions about who they are and why they do
what they do.

Obviously nobody gets to go back into their own past, but here's the cool thing: my future
is going to be someone else's past. I can travel in time to that past, send my message,
and watch those connections happen. If I really wanted to be subversive, I'd tell target
me to find a bunch of other people who are good at it and start spreading empathy like a
virus. BRB think I'm gonna go disrupt this timeline...
