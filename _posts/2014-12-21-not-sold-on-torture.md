title: Why I'm Not Sold on Torture
category: personal

The discussion about the Senate report on CIA interrogation seems to have died down, and
I'm left with a bad feeling. All sides of the issue that I've seen agree
that there are dangerous people meaning to do harm to US citizens, and
that the government should be working to stop them. The disagreement
seems to be about whether torturing people is justified to achieve that
end. I'm not convinced that it is.

I want to be able to say that justice is done in this country. That if
you stand suspected or accused of a crime, you will be treated fairly by
those in our justice system. That no guilt will be presumed, and
evidence will be collected and presented to adequately
demonstrate guilt before any sentence is imposed. I want this country to
lead by example and show the rest of the world that the system
works. That won't happen if we abandon those ideals when we feel like it.

Some of the arguments I've seen are baffling - like Jack Bauer on 24.
That show is fiction, and I expect that the situations and
outcomes reflect the real world of intelligence and
national security about as much as CSI reflects real world crime
scene investigation or Scorpion reflects real world computer tech.
We can't base our national policy on fiction. The lives at stake are real.

Given the gravity of the situation, I can see the appeal in arguing
that we should break the rules to save lives. Putting aside the issue
of a fair justice system and humane treatment of prisoners, is torturing
a suspect for information the best way to save lives? From a pragmatic
viewpoint, it seems pretty clear that it is not. Interrogation
has been happening for a very long time, and has been studied quite a
bit. All the studies I've seen show that torture is only effective
at obtaining bad intelligence - false confessions and partially true
information. The consistent conclusions are that the most effective
way to get accurate information is humane treatment of people.

None of this was a secret prior to recent events that led to the
Senate report. Which means one of three things about the people who
implemented and participated in the policy of torturing prisoners for
information:

* They had different information showing that it's an effective way to
  produce reliable intelligence, in which case I'm wrong.
* They didn't know that it was ineffective, in which case they were
  incompetent.
* They did know it was ineffective but went ahead with it anyway, in
  which case I'm more than a little concerned about their motivation.

I'd be happy to be wrong. I'd like to see studies showing that
torture is an effective way to get reliable intelligence.  It would
be pretty horrible that there is an argument for treating people
inhumanely, but the alternative is that the people behind the
interrogation program are messing up pretty badly. If that's true, we
need to fix it.
