It can't be that. He's acting normal and enjoying his usual routine. They said it might be calcium deposits, that must be it. The lab results probably got mixed up. It can't be that.

But it is, and it's not fair dammit. Not him, not that beautiful boy who's never been anything but sweet. Seriously, what the hell?!? I screamed at the universe until I had no voice, and the universe was silent. YOU SUCK UNIVERSE!

There has to be something we can do. Treatment is getting better all the time, right? Just let me know what it will take. Money? Take it. One year of my life for one of his? Take it.

The labs don't lie though. Or the xrays, or the ultrasound, or the blood tests. Stage 2. It's in his lungs already, and he'll be gone too soon. I don't want a daily routine without him. I don't want to sleep because he won't be there next to the bed. I don't want to go out because he won't be there, barking his way into the car to go along.

This is what we signed up for though, and we got more than our fair share. 10 - no, 10.7 and counting - years of love and adventure. Of seeing eyes widen and smiles brighten when people saw him walking around his town. Of seeing his eyes widen and smile brighten when we went to his favorite places, and got him ice cream and french fries. Yeah, we got more than we deserved and we'll enjoy whatever time we have left. No regrets.
