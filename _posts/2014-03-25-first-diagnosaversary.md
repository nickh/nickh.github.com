title: One Year With Cancer - A Chester FAQ
category: personal
tags: cancer

Today marks one year since doctors found a grapefruit-sized germ cell tumor in my chest.
While my case was treatable and I feel pretty normal these days, I doubt a day has gone
by that I haven't thought about it. One year in, it's kind of interesting to reflect
on everything that's happened.

### tl;dr

By the time they found it, there was a lot going on. I'd lost 40 pounds and couldn't
eat much, was often short of breath, and had a heartbeat that people could hear from
several feet away. A visit to a cardiologist found fluid around my heart and some
questionable stuff happening between my heart and lungs. He suggested that I admit
myself to the hospital that day. My first CT scan showed a mass that we've come to
call "Chester" (because of where they found it) aka "The Chesticle" (because germ
  cell tumors are usually testicular.)

I spent eight days in the hospital. They started me on prednisone right away, and
ran me through a five-day round of chemo as soon as they could get the drugs. The
treatment had an immediate effect and within a few days I felt pretty darn good. I
had an appetite, the fluid around my heart was gone, and my left lung was working again.

Over the next few months I went through two more rounds of chemo, followed up with
regular PET scans to track any changes. The trend is encouraging; Chester continues
to shrink and within a few months should be gone.

### Slow Descent

When the doctors found the tumor, it was about 13.5cm x 12.5cm and wrapped around my
heart, left airway, and part of my neck. People who hear this story often ask how
things could have gotten that bad without knowing something was wrong. There are
two answers: we did know something was wrong and had been looking into it for months,
and also it involved a combination of very gradual changes.

The first symptom I noticed was heartburn. This happens to a lot of people, and I
chalked it up to aging. Then I got hit with a sudden case of laryngitis. It went away
after a few days, then came back a month later and stuck around. My doctor suggested
that these symptoms were consistent with reflux, and there was good reason to agree.
It's common with people my age, and my mother and both brothers have it.  The doctor
gave me samples of Aciphex and I seemed to respond. But Aciphex is new and expensive,
and insurance prefers to cover older, cheaper alternatives. Doctors tried prescribing
more standard options like Prilosec, but they all seemed to make me feel worse.

The symptoms didn't clear up, which makes sense in retrospect. My laryngitis wasn't
caused by acid in my esophagus, but by Chester hitting a nerve in my neck. My shortness
of breath wasn't caused by lack of exercise, but by Chester closing off my left airway.
And none of this happened overnight, it took months.

My regular doctor referred me to a GI specialist. On New Year's Eve 2012 I had an
endoscopy, and though everything looked normal I kept getting worse. The reflux meds
weren't helping, and I scheduled a physical hoping a more in-depth look would turn up
something else. After a one-month wait my doctor finally had a look and the only new
thing he found was a heart murmur. He suggested I schedule a cardiac ultrasound,
which I did. While I was waiting for that, my GI doctor heard a bit of a rattle in
my lungs and suggested a pulmonary consult. I wasn't able to contact the pulmonologist
before the cardiac appointment but I did see her. She's the doctor who told me that
I had cancer.

There's a story that if you put a frog in a pot of water and heat it gradually enough,
the frog won't notice that things are going wrong and will eventually die in the
boiling water. It sounds like frogs will in fact notice and jump out, but there's a
lesson there. My symptoms were all gradual changes. I would notice something new,
but it would go away and I'd feel fine. After a few times I came to think of it as
part of the new normal.

I did suspect something else was wrong, and I had plenty of feedback and concern from
family and friends that corroborated my suspicions. That's what kept me going back
to the doctors. It turns out that the human body is quite hard to debug, and symptoms
often have more than one possible explanation. My doctors focused on the most likely
cause, and that's cool. That said, I hope that they'll throw a few extra tests at
the next patient that presents with similar symptoms.

### Support

Several people remarked that I maintained a positive attitude throughout the experience.
In part, this was about perspective. I know how deadly this could have been and how
much worse the treatment could have been. I was lucky that I got the kind of cancer
I did when I did. I was also fortunate to have support from an amazing wife and an
outstanding group of family and friends.

Judi and I announced the diagnosis on Facebook. Within minutes I was getting messages
of encouragement and support from family, geek friends, work friends, dog friends,
and Facebook friends. There were frequent visits while I was in the hospital and
after I got back home. Old and new friends in the Berner community sent crazy socks.
The socks still make me emotional when I remember getting them and wearing them to
chemo, or when I visit my collection.

If someone you know is going through something like this, let them know that you're
thinking of them and that you're available. They might need someone to walk the dog,
or run an errand. Sometimes they just want to talk, or play a game, or get caught up
on what's going on in the world. Or maybe they just like to have someone in the room
watching a movie with them.

### Treatment

When you find out that you have cancer, you may be confronted with many treatment
options. I had several conversations with my oncologist, and also got many suggestions
from family and friends. My general approach was to give more weight to those who
had studied up on the particulars of Chester, and less weight to those who suggested
something that "fights cancer."

The deal is that cancer is not one disease. It is a family of diseases with a similar
attack vector. The efficacy of treatments can vary quite a bit depending on what type
of cancer you're dealing with. Germ cell tumors tend to respond well to the chemo
cocktail of Bleomycin, Etoposide, and Cisplatin. It's weird that someone figured out
that a combination of mold, tree sap, and platinum electrolysis juice works best.
Weird or not, I am incredibly grateful to the cancer researchers who tested so many
possible treatments against so many different types of cancer. It's because of that
process that germ cell cancer is usually a curable disease today. In the early 1970s,
the cure rate was around 10%. If this tumor had started growing when I was in middle
school, I likely wouldn't have survived. By the early 1980s, the cure rate was around
85%. Given the different treatment options I could have gone with, I feel pretty good
about the one that's known to perform that well.

My first round of chemo happened during my 8-day stay in the hospital, administered
in a private room. Rounds 2 and 3 happened at the outpatient facility near the hospital.
It's a nice room with comfy chairs, a decent view, and an unlimited supply of Ritz
crackers which for some reason I craved. Most days they treated me along with 3-4
other patients. My first visit there was a bit of an eye-opener. It was not the first
time that I'd walked into a room full of people like me. But I was not prepared for
the instant and deep bond you form when you meet another cancer patient.

Chemotherapy has a well-deserved reputation for kicking the crap out of you. It's
good at killing cancer cells, but it's also really good at killing other healthy
cells. It frequently takes out your GI tract, which causes nausea. It also frequently
takes out your hair, which causes baldness. I was prepared for both of these with
a variety of anti-nausea meds and [a razor](http://nickh.hengeveld.com/dwi.gif).
There were also things I didn't expect, like "chemo brain." I heard the term from
another cancer survivor, and immediately knew what they meant. There are things that
used to stick in my brain that just vanished. Things that I know were in there and
should be able to recall, but found myself completely unable to do so. At least
there were computers and tablets and smart phones all over the place, and I did
remember how to Google.

### Recovery

The chemotherapy recovery process has a long tail. Some things come back relatively
quickly but maybe not quite the same at first. Some things take a while.

There was a period of several months I thought I felt back to normal. A few weeks
later I'd think back and realize that I was still improving and hadn't felt normal
after all. The process of getting sick was a slow one, and so was the process of
getting well. My appetite came back pretty fast. My hair came back, a little darker
and soft as felt at first and later back to it's pre-Chester color and texture. My
brain came back and once again annoys Judi with useless trivia.

After the effects of chemo had worn off, I wasn't feeling the effects of Chester
either. My doctor scheduled a PET scan and expected to find a "complete response."
Instead they found that it was still there, just smaller and less active. Since then
I've gotten to be a pro at PET scans - at least laying still and taking a nap during
the scan. When my doctor saw the first PET images, he was surprised that Chester was
still there but described it as "not very impressive." I think I would choose to
measure tumors on a different scale than how "impressive" they are, but I suppose
I'm not an oncologist.

### You've Changed, Man!

I don't feel like I've had a huge transformation. For the most part life seems back
to normal, but the process has changed me in a few respects - some subtle and some
less so.

I feel like I'm more laid back about most things. Often I'll recognize a situation
where I used to get worked up, and smile because in the scheme of things it's just
not a big deal.

I've thought about cancer every day for the past year, and expect that I will think
about it every day for the rest of my life. I've reached a problematic age where
random aches and pains pop up out of nowhere. Before, I laughed them off as just me
getting old. Now they trigger an internal monologue. Is this normal or cancer? Is
it a one-time thing or is it recurring? Should I wait or call my oncologist? It's
kind of surreal. Also, I have an oncologist. That's just weird.

I came to appreciate the lack of hair maintenance when I was bald. These days I cut
my own hair, and it never gets longer than about a #2.

I used to smoke things once in a while before I found out what it was like to lose
a lung. Never again. Fortunately there are plenty of alternatives.

Twenty years ago Judi gave me the ok to get a tattoo in exchange for my ok to get a
kitten. She got the kitten right away, and I finally got the tattoo. It took me that
long to figure out what I wanted and where I wanted it. In retrospect, I'm glad I
didn't pull the trigger on many of the earlier ideas, because they no longer make
sense. There is now a phoenix on my right forearm - a mythical bird rising from the
ashes. I love the symbolism of surviving cancer as rising from the ashes of Chester
and chemo. Whatever else happens, I'll be a cancer survivor for the rest of my life.

In my mind, life is now split into two distinct periods: BC (before Chester) and
AD (after diagnosis.) It's interesting to look back and exciting to look forward.
Happy 1AD everyone!
