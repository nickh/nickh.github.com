I've been a GitHub employee for about two months, prior to which I'd been
doing web application development at a few other Bay Area companies.
While working for one of them, I learned a little bit about
agile software development in the form of Scrum.  I got pretty excited
about the idea of delivering more often and more predictably and was
able to work in that environment to various degrees at several
companies.  I knew that GitHub
[does things differently](http://zachholman.com/talk/how-github-uses-github-to-build-github)
so I was curious how I'd like the environment here.  The short answer:
it's been fantastic; I have never spent this much of my time writing
code and getting features and fixes deployed.

I've been in the tech industry since 1988, and have had the opportunity
to work in many different environments - from huge companies like IBM to
tiny brand new startups to old midsize non-profits.  They all shared
many elements of administrative overhead: regular status and planning
meetings, periodic performance review meetings and documentation,
backlog and bug database maintenance, etc.  Until GitHub, it never
occurred to me how much of my time I wasn't getting stuff done.

People sometimes think it's an exaggeration when they hear the sound bite
version of how GitHub works: no meetings or management, developers drinking
and coding, no deadlines, anyone deploying to production whenever they feel
like it and finding out about production problems when users tweet about
it.  There's truth to all of that, and it's continued to work as GitHub
has scaled up to a very engineering-heavy 50+ employees.

From what I've seen of both approaches, one of the key differences is
trust.  Not trust in specifics like meeting a deadline or an
annual performance line item, but in the more general sense of
communicating well and making good choices.  If your team has that kind
of trust, there's no need for most of the typical administrative
overhead.  If you know that features will be deployed and bugs will be
fixed in the right priority and in a reasonable time frame, there's no
need to spend hours making educated guesses about when things will
happen and in what order.

I started at GitHub at the beginning of a quarter.  In any of the other
companies I've worked for, that would have meant a few days of writing
self and peer review documents and meeting with management to discuss
objectives of the past and upcoming quarters.  The applications I work
on tend to be moving targets, so what I'd done during a given quarter
rarely matched the plans we'd discussed at the beginning of the quarter.
Every time I went through the review process, it became a game of
retroactively writing planning documents that fit what happened during
the quater.  And all that time I wasn't writing any code.

In two months at GitHub, I've self-managed, enjoyed a few beers and
whiskeys while coding, deployed two big feature releases and plenty of
incremental updates and fixes, and watched the internet for feedback on
how my app was working.

This may sound like chaos, but it's not; GitHub is one of the most
stable applications I've worked on.  The team is passionate about
quality and has the right automation in place to keep testing and
deployment simple, accessible and reliable.

I'm really looking forward to looking back on my first two years here.
